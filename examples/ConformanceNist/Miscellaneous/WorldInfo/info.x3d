    <meta content='This file tests the ability of a browser to parse the WorldInfo node, and its "info" field. Because the WorldInfo node does not affect the loaded world&apos;s appearance or behavior, this test simply examines the browser&apos;s ability to read the WorldInfo node, parse it, and execute the loaded world properly. The viewer should see a white cube geometry with a black background, centered at the origin of the local coordinate system. In addition, no error or warning messages regarding the WorldInfo node should be displayed.' name='description'/>
