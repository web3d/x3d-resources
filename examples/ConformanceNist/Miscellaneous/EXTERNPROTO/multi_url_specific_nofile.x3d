    <meta content='This tests browser ability to select a specific PROTO if a "#PROTOname" is supplied at the end of the URL in a "list" of URLs, but one of the URL files does not exist. Two wrl file URLs are contained in the file URL list at the end of the EXTERNPROTO declaration, however the first file does not exist. The second file contains 3 PROTOs, with one matching the PROTO name of "Red_sphere" specified after the EXTERNPROTO statement. Because the first file does not exist, the browser should continue its search for the PROTO name in the next URL, and find the matching PROTO name. This PROTO should be used, and rendered as a red Sphere.' name='description'/>
