    <meta content='This is a test of a PROTO to route events internally within its PROTO body. A blue Sphere geometry has a TouchSensor associated with it. An SFBool field is generated each time the pointing device passes over the geometry. This event is internally routed the the "on" field of a DirectionalLight. The result is: Each time the pointing device passes over the geometry, the blue Sphere should be illuminated.' name='description'/>
