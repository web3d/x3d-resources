    <meta content='Test of browser ability to generate normals to vertices of an ElevationGrid geometry. The top half of a flat ElevationGrids vertices have a normal to the ElevationGrid plane, pointing downward (-Y). The remaining vertices have a similar normal applied, but with a (+Y) direction. As a result, the top half of the geometry will be illumnated, while the bottom half is not illuminated. This is true for both front and rear views.' name='description'/>
