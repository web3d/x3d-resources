# [meta] description: Test mpeg1 systems file playback. The VTS logo should appear on all faces of the Box geometry, upright and centered horizontally and vertically. The VTS logo should rotate  in a single loop from right to left when the user clicks on the  "starttime=NOW" text. Also, an audio track with  the spoken  letters V, T and S should be audible when the VTS logo completes a  revolution.
