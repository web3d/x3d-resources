    <meta content='Map a 256 by 256 pixel JPG image to a box. For the sides, the S texture axis should be parallel to the XZ plane, and the T texture axis should be parallel to the YZ plane. For the top of the box, the S (horizontal) axis of the texture should be parallel with the X axis, and the T (vertical) axis should be parallel with the Z axis. When viewed from the top, S texture values should increase to the right, and T values should increase upward. For the bottom of the box, the S (horizontal) axis of the texture should be parallel with the X axis, and the T (vertical) axis should be parallel with the Z axis. When viewed from the bottom, S values should increase to the right, and T values should incrase upward.' name='description'/>
