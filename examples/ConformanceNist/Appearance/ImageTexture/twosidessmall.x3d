    <meta content='Test JPG mappping with two equal length small sides of a bounding box. Map a JPG image to an IndexedFaceSet. The bounding box for this geometry has two equal length short sides (X and Y) and one longer side (Z). The VTS logo will be projected onto the bounding box with the S axis corresponding to the long Z axis of the bounding box, and the T axis corresponding to the X axis. The result: the top and bottom of the IndexedFaceSet should have the VTS logo, with the bottom of the logo along the Z axis. All remaining faces have the "smeared" end pixels of the front and rear textures.' name='description'/>
