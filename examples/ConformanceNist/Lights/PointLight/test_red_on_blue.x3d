    <meta content='This test addresses the ability of a browser to apply a red light on a blue object. Four simple geometries are defined on the local coordinate system and the emissive and diffuse color are both set to 0 0 1. A point light is also defined and a red color is associated with it. This light illuminates the objects making them look black. The dot product of the light and object color produce a black appearing object.' name='description'/>
