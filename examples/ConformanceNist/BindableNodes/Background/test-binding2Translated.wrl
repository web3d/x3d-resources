# [meta] description: This test addresses the ability of a background node to send TRUE events when it is the currently binded background. Two backgrounds are defined in the local coordinate system. The first one is binded by default. The test then sends a FALSE event to the first background and TRUE event to the second background. This will make the second background the currently binded background. The first background should then start sending FALSE events (via the is_Bound field). These events are caputure and use to start a timer. The test should generate a blue sky color image with some text flashing on it. The test can be started by clicking on the text displayed when the test is first started. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SECOND BACKGROUND IS FORCED TO BE THE CURRENT BACKGROUND BY SENDING A TRUE EVENT TO IT.
