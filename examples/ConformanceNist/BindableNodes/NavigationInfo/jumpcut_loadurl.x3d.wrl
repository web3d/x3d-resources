# [meta] description: Test jumpcut Viewpoint transition using Script loadUrl method. A NavigationInfo type of ANY is NOT included in the NavigationInfo node  field in this world.  Consequently, a Script node with a call to the "loadURL" method, with a url corresponding to the MFString  "Top_View" (the name of a Viewpoint in this world) should create a "jump cut" transition of views when the Box geometry in this world is indicated by the pointing device. As a result, indicating the Box geometry should result in a Viewpoint transition to the top view of the Box geometry.
