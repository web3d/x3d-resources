    <meta content='Test jumpcut with Anchor node. A NavigationInfo type of ANY is NOT included in the NavigationInfo node field in this world. Consequently, an Anchor node, with a url field of "Top_View" (corresponding to the name of Viewpoint in this world) should create a "jump cut" transition of views when the Box geometry in this world is indicated by the pointing device. As a result, indicating the Box geometry should result in a Viewpoint transition to the top view of the Box geometry.' name='description'/>
