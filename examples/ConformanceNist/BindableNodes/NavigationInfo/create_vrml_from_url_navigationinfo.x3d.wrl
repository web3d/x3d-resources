# [meta] description: Test NOT binding a NavigationInfo node generated by Create_Vrml_From_Url.  A NavigationInfo node is introduced into this world via the createVrmlFromURL method of an EcmaScript script node. The url used in the script points to a  file containing a NavigationInfo node with a type of EXAMINE .   Because the NavigationInfo node is introduced via a createVrmlFromURL method, it should not be bound to the top of the stack.  As a result, navigation should be of the default type WALK ANY  and produce a walking type of navigation.  In addition, a Text message  should appear stating that the scripted NavigationInfo node is not bound,  and that its isBound field is set to FALSE.
