    <meta content='Test Inlining. A NavigationInfo node is introduced into this world via the Inline node. The Inline file contains a NavigationInfo node with a type of EXAMINE. Because the NavigationInfo node is introduced via an Inline node, it should not be bound to the top of the stack. As a result, navigation should be of the default type [WALK,ANY] and produce a "walking" type of navigation. In addition, a Text message should appear stating that the Inlined NavigationInfo node is not bound, and that its isBound field is set to false.' name='description'/>
