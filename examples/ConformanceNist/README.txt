The ConformanceNist Test Suite Examples were authored by National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide complete test set for the
Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML97).  They were automatically converted
into X3D and provide approximate coverage for the Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics
Immersive Profile.

The ConformanceNist X3D Examples Archive was converted from the original
VRML Test Suite (VTS) that was produced by a team at the U.S. National Institute
of Science and Technology (NIST) in 1999. This open-source archive was designed
using an interactive conformance testing methodology that continues to work well
today. It provides a huge number of rendering and behavior examples to help
verify X3D scene and player conformance matching the Immersive Profile of the
X3D Specification.

Archive support includes X3D-Edit authoring tool, X3D Tooltips, X3D Validator,
complete course slidesets and videos, plus this open-source model archive.
Source changes are maintained in version control and bug tracking is online.
