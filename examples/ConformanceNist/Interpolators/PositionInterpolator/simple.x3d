    <meta content='Test of basic PositionInterpolator functionality. A PositionInterpolator node is used to change the position of a Box geometry. The fraction_changed field of a TimeSensor node is used to change the position from keyValues of [ 0 0 0, -2 0 0, 0 0 0, 2 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 2 0, 0 -2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 -2, 0 0 2, 0 0 0 ] for keys of [ [0.0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.40, 0.48, 0.56, 0.64, 0.72, 0.80, 0.88, 0.96] respectively. As a result: the Box geometry will move successively to those 13 positions in a 5 second interval.' name='description'/>
