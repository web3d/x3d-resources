    <meta content='Test if PlaneSensor works for default field values. A PlaneSensor is associated with a red Box geometry. When pressing left mouse button over the red box and dragging, the Box should translate in the X and Y direction by the same amount as the indicating pointing device moves in the XY plane intersected by the bearing line of the pointing device. Movement should not be restricted or "clamped" in the X or Y direction. The Box should not "snap back" to its original position each time it is indicated by the pointing device.' name='description'/>
