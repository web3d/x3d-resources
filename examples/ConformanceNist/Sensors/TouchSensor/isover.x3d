    <meta content='Test if a TouchSensor generates an isOver true event when the pointing device bearing intersects the white Sphere geometry. The isOver event of the TouchSensor associated with the white Sphere is routed to the "on" field of a PointLight. When the pointing device is over the central white sphere, the PointLight inside of sphere should turn on, illuminating the red Spheres around it. When the pointing device bearing does not intersect the white Sphere, the PointLight should be off.' name='description'/>
