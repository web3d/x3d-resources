    <meta content='Test if bboxSize is parsed. This test defines an Inline node that sets the bounding box size equal to the actual size of the world. An image texture is then mapped to the geometry in question (IndexedFaceSet) to test if the bboxSize and bboxCenter fields are parsed. The bboxCenter field is assigned a value of 0 0 0 and bboxSize is set to 2 2 2. The test should generate without errors.' name='description'/>
