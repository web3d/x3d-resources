    <meta content='Test browser to nest multiple Anchor nodes in the children field of a parent Anchor node. This test defines an Anchor node with three Shape nodes as children (within another Anchor node). Each child is associated with a different url. The files referenced in the url fields are stored in the same directory where the calling Anchor file is. The test should generate a blue box if the first sphere is clicked, a blue cone if the second one is clicked and a blue cylinder if the third one is clicked. No viewpoints are associated with the url fields.' name='description'/>
