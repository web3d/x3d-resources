    <meta content='This test defines a Transform that specifies an offset along the Y axis from the center of the local coordinate system. The test should draw three cylinders, one at the center of the local coordinate system, one at the bottom and one at the top rotated 1.57 radians along the Z axis. following is the main parent transform with center at origin.' name='description'/>
