X3D Mesh Design Pattern for Scanner Output                 revised 6 June 2017

==============================================================================
1. Potential improvements to X3D specification

a. boolean indexMatch indicating identical coordIndex, colorIndex, normalIndex

b. Consider allowing Normal node within PointSet and IndexedLineSet nodes
   in order to support partial scan output (might produce points but not mesh)

c. Consider adding Switch and ViewpointGroup to X3D Interchange Profile

==============================================================================
2. Information of interest

a. Scan Metadata
- Date, time, person performing scan, location
- Lighting, mounting, positioning
- Registration info: markers, april tags, QR codes, etc.
- Description and annotation comments of note

b. Scanner Metadata
- Make, model, software version

c. Object Metadata
- description of object being scanned
- Identifying information: serial number, UUID, etc.
- Photographs, drawings
- Reference url links

d. Mesh Metadata
- meshInformationAvailable?
- center
- bounding box
- vertexSpacing
- colorsQuantized?
- colorsAvailable, normalsAvailable, texturesAvailable (simplifies tool access)
- waterTight, i.e. closed hull?
- fidelity and resolution information: accuracy, lossy, etc.
- imageTexture available?
- textureTransform available?
