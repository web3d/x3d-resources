							Active work is creating, archiving and modifying
							Additive Manufacturing&nbsp;(AM)
							example models that are suitable for 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing" target="_blank">3D&nbsp;printing</a>.
							Since many Additive Manufacturing designs are produced by
							Computer Aided Design (CAD) engineering tools, you might also look at the
							<a href="../../../CAD/../CAD/index.html" target="_blank">CAD&nbsp;examples</a>
							and the
							<a href="https://www.web3d.org/realtime-3d/working-groups/computer-aided-design-cad" target="_blank">X3D CAD Working Group</a>.

							Technical Report TR-NAVFAC-EXWC-EX-1601, 
							NAVFAC Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC), Port Hueneme California, April 2016.
							From the abstract:
							"The intent of the project was to investigate the end-to-end process of transferring, receiving, manipulating, and printing a digital 3D model 
							into an additively manufactured component. Several digital models were exchanged, and the steps, barriers, workarounds, and results have been documented."
							Numerous X3D examples, conclusions and recommendations are included.
