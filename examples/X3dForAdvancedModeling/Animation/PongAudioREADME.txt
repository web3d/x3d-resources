The audio file pong.wav was created using the video editing tool 
Movavi Video Editor Plus 2 (MVEP), Movavi Screen Recorder 21 (MSR), 
and Movavi Video Converter 21 Premium (MVC).  I used MSR to record a 
1972 Pong Atari video posted to YouTube at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhd7FfGCdCo.  
I edited the video using MVEP so that a portion of the sounds from the
video were in synchronization with the PongGame scene animation.  
I then used MVC to save the file in .wav format, which is supported by X3D.
