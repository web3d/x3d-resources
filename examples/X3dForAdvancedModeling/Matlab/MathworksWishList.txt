X3D Recommendations for Mathworks

Matlab is a tremendous tool for mathematics, science and engineering.  Adding
full support for X3D Graphics will make it even better.

1.  Upgrade from VRML to also include support for Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics
International Standard, with no loss of backwards compatibility.

2.  More examples showing X3D usage, both HTML5/X3D and video demonstrations.

3.  Updated examples using X3DOM as a plugin-free approach for publishing user
projects to the Web.  Consider releasing Javascript library to allow Simulink
to drive *any* X3D player and Web browser, in addition to the bundled VR Sink
module that comes with the Matlab Simulink 3D Animation toolbox. 

4.  Update scene authoring support, and add connections to utilize the many
X3D Quality Assurance (QA) tools for content correctness and validity.

5. Mathworks needs to join the Web3D Consortium to ensure that Matlab users
have the best possible support from Web standards.

6. The X3D Community will be happy to provide help and support.

Additional suggestions and questions are always welcome.

Very respectfully,
