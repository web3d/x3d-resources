                X3DOM (pronounced X-Freedom) is an experimental open source-framework and runtime 
                to support the ongoing discussion in the Web3D and W3C communities how an integration of HTML5 and declarative 3D content could look like. 
                It tries to fulfill the current HTML5 specification for declarative 3D content and allows including X3D elements as part of any HTML5 DOM tree.
    </p>
    
    <p>
                 This directory first examines examples provided by the X3DOM project,
                 then provides further examples that illustrate the automatic production of
                 X3DOM HTML5 pages containing adapted, embedded X3D models converted from standalone .x3d scenes.
