<blockquote>
"These cards evolved from our separate observations of the
principles underlying what we are doing. Sometimes they
were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with
intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were
happening, sometimes they were formulated.
They can be used as a pack (a set of posibilities being
continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single
card from a shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a
working situation.
In this case the card is trusted even if it appropriateness
is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present
themselves, and others will become self-evident."</font>
