===========================================================================

BS Contact

- Support for Geometry 2D nodes incomplete/missing
- relative address for Script url embedded in ProtoDeclare doesn't look in directory of ProtoDeclare, 
    rather it looks from directory of ProtoInstance
- Default NavigationInfo type='"EXAMINE" "ANY"' but BS Contact uses incorrect VRML97 default of  type='"WALK" "ANY"'
    (e.g. <NavigationInfo speed='4'/> is incorrectly).  Works OK if no NavInfo is provided.
- Text MIDDLE MIDDLE vertical alignment position is ~15% different from InstantReality
- Text string is not passed correctly within prototype (see Web3dTimeline.x3d)
- Annoyance: no hotkey for reload (e.g. Ctrl-R)
- Need to support 'class' attribute on all .x3d nodes, fails otherwise
- Console buffer is too small (example: Torus in trace mode)

===========================================================================

InstantReality
- Annoyance: default screen aspect ratio is atypical and can't be reset via a user preference
- Text MIDDLE MIDDLE vertical alignment position is ~15% different from BS Contact
- Mistaken ProtoDeclare error when IS/connect is defined:
    Invalid Field dec, "value" missing for accessType inputOutput
- Menu system with viewpoint list should call viewpoints Viewpoints, not Cameras
- Viewpoint description display should be simple to help end users, without complicated diagnostics

===========================================================================

Xj3D
- Improve default rendering quality (anisotropic default values)
    TextureQuality, PrimitiveQuality Xj3D_AntialiasingQuality Xj3D_FPSShown

    http://www.web3d.org/files/specifications/19775-1/V3.2/Part01/components/networking.html#t-BrowserProperties
- Text MIDDLE MIDDLE alignment aligns to top rather than MIDDLE
- Extrusion issues!!!
- Can limited widget bar be shown for only Viewpoint names, selection?
- ViewpointGroup support, both for node and user interface
- Missing image loaders in initial startup console
- Image load causes throttle warning (-numLoaderThreads ?)
- Binary compression has many errors
    - proto exceptions
- offline rendering problems:
    - doesn't always time out on error
    - fails on audio or movie present
- get volunteers on source javadoc
- get volunteers on Xj3D.org documentation pages

Xj3D common single trunk, eliminate need for branch(es)
- finish merging NPS branch
- current build.xml renamed as build_original.xml (uses nonstandard Ant practices)
- build_nps.xml as default build.xml file (since it uses common Ant practices),
    or common build.xml that imports either build_nps.xml and build_original.xml
- nbproject subdirectory needs to be moved into root directory of Xj3D trunk,
    fails otherwise - build task needed
- merge Vince Marchettis NURBS modifications
- merge HyoKwang Lee's PartDB modifications
- establish SourceForge issues list
- confirm/deny then merge NPS and Xj3D bugzilla lists with SourceForge list
