BaseType needed to be changed to Base to compile?
Removed CollisionNodeType to get compiling.  Not in base spec anymore either
Changed ScriptNodeType profile to Immersive as Script node does not include Extensibility Profile
Removed class globalAttribute because it was creating a getClass call on BaseNode which tries to override the Java getClass method and fails

Changed BaseNodeArray to extend BaseFieldArray instead of BaseNode
	Makes BaseNodeArray(MFNode) be a field instead of a node type

Removed Base type.  There are no common methods to fields, nodes, scenegraphstructure objects...
Made profile on X3D required and no default

9/19/2002
Changed BaseField to X3DField, BaseFieldArray to X3DArrayField
Changed BaseNode to X3DNode
Changed Boolean to X3DBoolean... all the rest of the types

Changed X3DWorldInfoNode to X3DInfoNode

9/20/2002

Moved X3DFontStyleNode to extend X3DNode instead of X3DGeometricPropertyNode as current base spec
Moved X3DGroupingNode to extend X3DNode
	Added X3DBoundedObject as other interfaces to nodes extending X3DGroupingNode

**WatchList on LoadSensor is not a GroupingNode at least as abstract spec, but watchList does need grouping(element) children
Changed X3DBoundedObject to be a top-level type only usable as otherInterfaces.  Had to add bboxCenter and size to each object
Inline/GeoInline is not a grouping node.  Changed to X3DChildNode and X3DBoundedObject
Added X3DUrlObject.  Converted all url containing objects to use in otherInterfaces.  The Url attribute must be still be hand added.

XSLT:

9/18/2002

Changed BaseField to X3DField, BaseFieldArray to MField
Changed Boolean to X3DBoolean... all the rest of the types
Map StringsURL to X3DStrings
Map BoundingBoxSize to X3DVector3Float

Ignore ContainedNodeLabel and WildcardNodeType in code generation
	Used a x3d:choose instead of catching all ContainedNodeLabel to avoid element processing.  Need XSLT syntax
