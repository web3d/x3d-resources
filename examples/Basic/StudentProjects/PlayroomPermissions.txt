Gentlemen,
I have made the requested corrections to my final project for loading to savage.
The attached zip file contains my final project with the updates. I will load it
onto the class directory tomorrow. This version has image textures optimized for
file size and 4 way repeating. This is the playroom version with the rocking chair
and spinning balls. My midterm version was loaded on savage by mistake.
This one is much better...
 
All my patterns and images came from the following sources:
 
brick.jpg is from the VRML 2.0 sourcebook
 
PrintShopFloorWood.jpg is a pattern I built off of a printshop image.
(I clipped it, made it 4 way repeat, and optimized the filesize.)
 
RoofRock.jpg is a pattern I built off of a printshop image.
(I clipped it, made it 4 way repeat, and optimized the filesize.)
 
StuccoCeiling.jpg  is a pattern I built off of a printshop image.
(I clipped it, made it 4 way repeat, and optimized the filesize.)
 
Tree1.png is from the VRML 2.0 sourcebook
 
BushPattern.png is a modified version of the Tree1.jpg file above.
 
The rest are modified from real world digital pictures I took.
 
R/S,
Vaughn Pangelinan
