							Long-running efforts have attempted to define and build a new
							<a href="NetworkSensorConnectionNodes.html" target="_blank">NetworkSensor node</a>
							for X3D.
							Although useful design progress was made by the X3D working group, this work did not reach closure
							because author-written implementations did not appear to be possible using X3D prototypes
							encapsulating sandbox-restricted JavaScript network access from within an HTML browser.
							Further implementation and evaluation work might someday be pursued using an X3D browser implementation.
						</p>

						<p>
							Examples of additional networking techniques for X3D
							can also be added to this archive.
							Of related interest: the
							<a href="../../../Networking/../DistributedInteractiveSimulation/index.html" target="_blank">Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)</a>
							examples in this archive, which include native X3D support for the
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation" target="_blank">IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)</a>
							networking-protocol standard.
