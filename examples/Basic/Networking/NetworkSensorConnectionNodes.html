<h1>Draft X3D Specification Addition for NetworkSensor capability</h1>
<h2>Document Status</h2>
<p>Work on these nodes has been discontinued, at least temporarily.
   Because the NetworkSensor node allows definition of new fields by name,
   a proper implementation requires native X3D-player support and a full
   Prototype-based implementation is not possible.  No X3D browser companies
   have yet committed to produce such an implementation.
    <br>
</p>
<p>Further questions can be directed to the
    <a href="mailto:x3d-public@web3d.org?subject=NetworkSensor%20node%20development">x3d-public@web3d.org</a>
    mailing list.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Specification draft updated June 12 2008<br>
</p>

<hr />

<h1>9 Networking Component</h1>
<p><i>Insert the following new sections 9.4.4 and 9.4.5 before section 9.5:</i></p>
<h2>9.4.4 Connection</h2>
<pre>Connection: X3DNetworkSensorNode {
    SFBool [in,out] enabled  TRUE
    SFNode [in,out] metadata NULL [X3DMetadataObject]
    SFBool        [out]      isActive FALSE
    MFString      [in,out]   url ["x3dp://localhost:80/"]
    SFInt32       [in]       protocol 0 [0,65535]
    SFTime        [in,out]   timeOut  0
    SFBool        [in]       secure   TRUE
}<br><br></pre>
<p>The Connection node specifies a network connection such as a TCP/IP
socket. The X3D Browser shall support at least two such nodes being
active at any one time. Support for more active Connection nodes can be
optionally supported.<br>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">url </span>field identifies
the <span style="font-style: italic;">application protocol</span>://<span style="font-style: italic;">network address</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">port number </span>triplet for the
stream in the style of urls. <br>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">protocol </span>field is a
code specifying the underlying protocol (such as HTTP, ftp, TCP/IP, UDP)
to use: 0 means
underlying protocol is defined by the application protocol, 1&nbsp; for
HTTP (default), 2 for HTTP1.1, 3 for TCP/IP, 4 for UDP, 5 for&nbsp;
multicast.&nbsp; <i>Multicast</i> support is optional because it can
be impractical to get it to work in a general public situation, due to
lack of control/access to routers. There is no onus on the X3D
application to have control
over multicast configuration of network nodes.<br>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">application protocol</span>
part of the address field identifies the higher level "application"
protocol the X3D application
is using over the underlying protocol specified in the <span style="font-style: italic;">protocol </span>field. If
the default HTTP underlying protocol is to be used then the prefix:
"http:" can be omitted and refers specifically to HTTP 1.0. When the
underlying protocol is
anything other than HTTP the default application protocol is "x3dp:" <br>
</p>
<p>The application protocol "x3dp:" refers to a basic common
application protocol to be defined in another X3D document. When it is
defined, it recommended that
"x3dp:" be
supported so there is at least one application protocol that all X3D
Browsers can interpret. Examples of other application protocols that
may be used
are "xmpp:", "dis:", and "swmp:".&nbsp; This specification shall,
however,&nbsp; be independent of the status of the common x3dp
application
protocol specification. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">url </span>may contain a list of
host address triplets, each formatted as: &lt;protocol&gt;&lt;host
address&gt;&lt;port number&gt;. For example, a <span style="font-style: italic;">url </span>may be:&nbsp;
["x3dp://224.2.181.145:7000" "http://224.2.181.145:7000"&nbsp;
"alternate.net.server"] or it may just be:
["localhost"]. It is recommended that each host be
initially tested for response so that non responding hosts can be
skipped for one that does respond. It is up to the implementation as
to how hosts are tested, whether in sequential order or parallel.
However, the
order hosts are listed is to be taken as the order of preference for
responding hosts. That is, if multiple hosts respond, the one listed
first is to be used. The <span style="font-style: italic;">url
</span>field may have an additional suffix
string such as initial path and authentication, for example:
"x3dp://localhost:80/pathid?initialAuthentication="authString".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <i>port number</i> part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">address </span>field identifies the port
to use, for example
"7000". </p>
<p>Note
that if more than one NetworkSensor refers to the same connection node
then the events from the NetworkSensor nodes shall be routed over the
same connection. By default, only two simultaneous active ports
are required to be supported.<br>
</p>
<p><i>isActive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is initially
FALSE and only becomes TRUE if the port is successfully opened.</span></p>
<p><i>enabled</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is initially TRUE
and means the browser should attempt to open the port. If set to
FALSE the port will be closed. If the port could not be opened the
browser will change enabled to FALSE.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><i>timeout</i> is the period of time to
wait, in milliseconds, before deciding a host is not responding. If a
connection times out, <span style="font-style: italic;">enabled </span>shall
be set to FALSE.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><i>secure</i> is TRUE by default and
means that only connections to the originating server are accepted.
The browser may optionally implement a <i>secure</i>=FALSE capability
in which case it will be possible for the web3d application to
communicate with non originating servers, but this is not as secure.</p>
<h2>9.4.5 NetworkSensor</h2>
<pre>NetworkSensor : X3DNetworkSensorNode {
    SFBool    [in,out] enabled         TRUE
    SFNode    [in,out] metadata        NULL  [X3DMetadataObject]
    SFBool    [out]    isActive
    SFNode    [in out] connection      NULL [Connection node only]
    SFString  [in]     httpRequest     ""
    MFString  [out]    httpResponse    NULL
    SFString  []       channelId       ""
    # And any number of:
    fieldType [in]     fieldName
    fieldType [in,out] fieldName
    fieldType [out]    fieldName
    fieldType []       fieldName
}
</pre>
<p>The NetworkSensor is intended to provide more efficient sending and
receiving of
events via a network connection than would normally be possible via an
external API. It acts as a high speed gateway between a network
stream and the X3D scene graph so routes can be set to/from it. It
defines a set of fields to be sent/received over a <span style="font-style: italic;">connection</span>.&nbsp; The connection
shall be non blocking: the node shall wait for a response without
suspending the execution of other Browser functions.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">Fan in of events is treated the same as
other nodes: multiple events received at the same "time" are not
buffered, they are sent as
one packet.&nbsp; In the case of HTTP, if the node is waiting on a
response then it is up to the Browser implementation to
buffer incoming MFString events or not.<br>
</p>
<p><i>enabled</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is initially TRUE.</span></p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">connection </span>specifies the
network connection to use.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">httprequest</span>&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">httpResponse</span> only apply when the
protocol is HTTP. The HTTP capability should allow for HTTP functions
such as POS, MGET, HEADER and others defined in HTTP. When the
protocol is HTTP, "fieldType" fields<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
are ignored.
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">httprequest </span>contains at
least a URL but this may be preceeded by a HTTP header. The X3D Browser
shall support the use
of standard URL encoded parameters with the special characters "?",
"=", """ and "&amp;" appended to the URL. The domain is already
specified in the
connection field.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">httpResponse </span>is the event
returned from a server in response to a HTTP request. The response must
be
in the form of an X3D MFNode. That is, the HTTP <span style="font-style: italic;">httprequest</span>-<span style="font-style: italic;">httpResponse </span>sequence shall
operate in a similar way as if it came from a CreateX3DFromUrl
call.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">channelId&nbsp; </span>identifies
the NetworkSensor node instance which corresponds to a communication channel. For example, two clients with the same channel id of 1 could communicate the same type of data between them.
This enables more than one NetworkSensor to use
the same <span style="font-style: italic;">connection </span>and the <span style="font-style: italic;">connection </span>can&nbsp; push the id's
over the network&nbsp; so a recipient can know which
NetworkSensor&nbsp; it came from.<br>
</p>
Any number of fields and field types can be defined.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> The transmission format will be
determined by the chosen protocol.<br>
The
default mapping order of fields to elements in transmission packets is
in-order.<br>
