This GeoVRML example illustrates the requirement for greater than
single-precision floating point support, and how the GeoOrigin node
helps to get around this limitation. In the two examples below, all of
the columns and slabs of the temple have been georeferenced to 1-meter
accuracy using the UTM coordinate system. The model on the left
essentially rounds all coordinates to single-precision - you will
notice that many of the columns are misaligned and that navigation is
jerky. The model on the right uses a GeoOrigin node to establish a
local coordinate system at the center of the temple - as a result, all
of the coordinates can be represented accurately within
single-precision and navigation is smooth.
