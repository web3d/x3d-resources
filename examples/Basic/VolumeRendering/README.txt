===========================================================================

1. You can download all of the necessary .nrrd data files from

* http://snoid.sv.vt.edu/medical/X3DVolumes/examples/datasets/datasets.zip

The destination to place all resulting .nrrd data files is local subdirectory

    datasets/nrrd

You will also need data file

* http://snoid.sv.vt.edu/medical/X3DVolumes/examples/datasets/nrrd/supine.nrrd

TODO add supine.nrrd to .zip file

===========================================================================
2. Alternate site

4. TEEM NRRD (Nearly Raw Raster Data) is a file format and software library
designed to support scientific visualization and image processing involving
N-dimensional raster data.  Details are found at

    http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd
