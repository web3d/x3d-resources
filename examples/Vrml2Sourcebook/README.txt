The VRML 2 Sourcebook is an outstanding textbook covering the Virtual Reality
Modeling Language (VRML) 97. The original examples from that book were the
first scenes converted into the Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics standard, showing
excellent coverage of VRML capabilities. Numerous additional examples found in
corresponding SIGGRAPH 98 course notes for the book are also provided. 

Archive support includes X3D-Edit authoring tool, X3D Tooltips, X3D Validator,
complete course slidesets and videos, plus this open-source model archive.
Source changes are maintained in version control and bug tracking is online.
