#  Vector
#	by David R. Nadeau
#
#  This world illustrates the use of a PROTO to define a generic
#  vector whose position, orientation, scale, and color are all
#  set by incoming fields.  The vector is used by "vecfld1.wrl"
#  to fill a volume with vectors, all pointing different directions
#  and with different colors.
