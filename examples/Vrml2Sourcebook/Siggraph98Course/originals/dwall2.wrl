#  Dungeon wall #2
#	by David R. Nadeau
#
#  This is a simple rectangular floor textured with a stone block
#  image.  An ElevationGrid node is used so that the floor is made
#  up of multiple polygons, each subject to individual lighting
#  calculations.  This insures that when a PointLight is placed
#  near the all, the area beside the light is bright, while the areas at
#  the corners are not.
