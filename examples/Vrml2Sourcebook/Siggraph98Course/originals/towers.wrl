#  The Tower
#  towers.wrl
#        by David R. Nadeau
#
#  This world illustrates the use of translation, rotation, and scaling to
#  build a multi-level tower.
#
#  A tower is built starting with a single pole and archway inlined
#  from "towerprt.wrl".  This part is instanced 12 times around the perimeter
#  of the tower by doing successive rotations.  Add a cylinder for the
#  ceiling, and a level is complete.
#
#  A level is then instanced three more times to build the next three upper
#  levels of the tower.  Each instance moves up to the next level, then
#  scales the generic level down a bit and puts it there.  This repeated
#  scaling is what gives the tower it's diminishing size for the upper
#  levels.
#
#  A glowing, rotating cube is added to the top of the generic tower.  An
#  OrientationInterpolator keeps the cube rotating.
#
#  Things to experiment with:
#        Add sound!
#
#        Add a spiraling ramp that leads to the upper levels.  Perhaps put
#        something interesting on each level.  Perhaps make the rotating
#        cube on top do something... such as be an Anchor leading to
#        another world!
