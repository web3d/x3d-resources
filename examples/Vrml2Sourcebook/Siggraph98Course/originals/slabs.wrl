#
#  This example illustrates use of Appearance and Material nodes to set
#  the main shading color (diffuseColor), glow color (emissiveColor), and
#  transparency level of a shape.
#
#  Seven slabs are created, each using a Box node.  Each slab is shaded
#  a different material:
#
#        Slab       Diffuse     Emissive    Transparency
#        White      white       black       0.0
#        Red        black       red         0.0
#        Green      green       black       0.5
#        Blue       blue        white       0.25
#        Yellow     yellow      black       0.5
#        Cyan       cyan        black       0.0
#        Magenta    red         magenta     0.0
#
#  Some PC browsers may not support transparency.  Others may not support
#  shading using both diffuse and emissive colors.  So, your results may
#  vary.
#
#  Things to experiment with:
#        Try different transparency levels.
#
#        Turn off the headlight on your VRML browser and observe which
#        slabs glow.
