                        A VisibilitySensor node checks if a region is visible to the viewer, where the region is described by a center and a size.
                        Time events are sent on entry and exit of visibility, and true/false is sent on entry and exit of visibility.
                        A ProximitySensor node similarly checks if the viewer is within a region, also sending viewer position and orientation while within the sensed region.
                        Collision is a grouping node that checks if the viewer has run into a shape defined by the node's children 
                        (or else simpler proxy geometry) with a collision time event sent upon contact.
